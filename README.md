# A-simple-example-of-neural-network-realized-by-tensorflow-in-python
1 This is a very simple example of a realization of a neural network by tensorflow  in python. Based on this very simple example, one can easily build a more complex neural network model, such as a CNN-like or RNN-like neural network.


2 The whole program is rather easy,  but orgnized in good manner.
