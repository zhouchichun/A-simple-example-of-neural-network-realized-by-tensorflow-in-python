# A-simple-example-of-neural-network-realized-by-tensorflow-in-python
1 This is a very simple example of a realization of a neural network (once you substitude the method such as sigmoid or tanh in this example by a MLP, CNN, or RNN) by tensorflow  with python. In this example, the relation between x and y are learned by a nonlinear compounded function. 


2 Based on this very simple example, one can easily build a more complex neural network model, such as a CNN-like or RNN-like neural network.


3 The whole program is rather easy,  but orgnized in good manner. For those who are new in using tensorflow and interesting in nueral network, this example might help you in some how.
